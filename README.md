- Hi, Iâ€™m @Gustavorsp

- I'm Ui Designer  Jr.

- My comfort is prototyping, I initially wanted to create the arts behind games, but I was taken to the side of web design.

- Soon I gained an opportunity to experience and exercise the function, creation and development of screens and projects,
- as I always lived close to technology and games.

- Having joined a company where they explore custom mice and live around this world,
it was great to start my career with a golden key and always be able to study around it.


That's it
